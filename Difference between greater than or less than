In C, which statement takes less cycles to execute? a) if (i<5) {..} b) if (i>0) {..}

Both the statements will take the same number of instructions 

for example in assembly the above code converts to 
a)
1. cmp i,5
2. jgt LABEL

b)
1. cmp i,0
2. jlt LABEL

Since both have the same type of instructions it would take up same number of processing cycles
